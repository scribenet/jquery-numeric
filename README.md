jquery-numeric
==============

Number validation for input fields

This is a fork of scribenet/jquery-numeric, and will be kept up to date with the original 
jquery-numeric : https://github.com/SamWM/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/numeric/jquery.numeric.js

I forked and made this repo simply to get it up on bower where it should be.
