jquery-numeric
==============

Number validation for input fields.

Will only alow user to type number and number related things like decimal points.

This is a fork and will be kept up to date with the original jquery-numeric : https://github.com/SamWM/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/numeric/jquery.numeric.js

DEMO : http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/numeric/

The only reason I made this repo is to get this up on bower for dependency management.
